# Misc random stuff

- `BOND` is worth 1000, but some bots are dumb, might want to have contracts out for it anyway
- `DICE` resolves to sum of 5 rolls of a d20; each team knows 1 roll, rolls are revealed iteratively
- three stocks: `A, B, C`. Fair value changes over time, known by one bot
- `ETF` resolves to `A+B+C`. You can exchange `A+B+C => ETF` for a 1% fee.
